	 * \brief Rigid body
	 *
	 * A rigid body holds the physical properties of an object. (mass, position, rotation, velocity, etc.) It does not
	 * have a shape until you attach one or more collision shapes to it. If youâ€™ve done physics with particles before,
	 * rigid bodies differ in that they are able to rotate. Rigid bodies generally tend to have a 1:1 correlation to
	 * sprites in a game. You should structure your game so that you use the position and rotation of the rigid body
	 * for drawing your sprite.
